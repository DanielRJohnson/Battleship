# Battleship
Group Project for EECS 448

Team 14: Saher Elsayed, Daniel Johnson, Trieu-Anh Nguyen, Maokun Huang, Rahul Purswani
    
"You sank my battleship!" Ah, the sounds of childhood Saturday afternoons and a really memorable ad campaign. Dense blue plastic, knobby little red and white pieces (which the dog always tried to eat), and really strategic guesswork. Now that was fun.
Rather than simply relying on nostalgia, Team 14 develops, tweaks, adds, and replots the game until you have not only the standard Battleship, but also a more visually pleasing game, that you can play with friends any time of the day.
