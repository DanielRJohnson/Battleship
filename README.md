# Battleship
Group Project for EECS 448

Team 14: Saher Elsayed, Daniel Johnson, Trieu-Anh Nguyen, Maokun Huang, Rahul Purswani
    
<br>"You sank my battleship!" Ah, the sounds of childhood Saturday afternoons and a really memorable ad campaign. Dense blue plastic, knobby little red and white pieces (which the dog always tried to eat), and really strategic guesswork. Now that was fun.
<br>Rather than simply relying on nostalgia, Team 14 develops, tweaks, adds, and replots the game until you have not only the standard Battleship, but also a more visually pleasing game, that you can play with friends any time of the day.
